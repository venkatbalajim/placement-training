# Placement Training Repository

Welcome to my **placement-training** repository! This repository contains all the **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)** problems I solved during my on-campus placement training.

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized by date, so you can track my progress and the concepts covered each day. The folder names indicate the date range for each batch of problems, like `Nov 10 2024 - Nov 13 2024`.

## Programming Languages

The solutions are primarily written in:
- **Java** (most solutions)
- **Python**

## Contact

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via [venkatbalajim.cse2022@citchennai.net](mailto:venkatbalajim.cse2022@citchennai.net).

_Happy Coding!_
